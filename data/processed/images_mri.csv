CT:  There is an expansile intra-osseous lesion, measuring approximately 3.1 x 1.3 cm, in the right frontal bone, with a thin sclerotic rim with preservation of the trabeculae. There is an apparent disruption in the cortex anteriorly, which is well corticated and likely represents an enlarged
feeding vessel. There is no periosteal reaction.

MRI: Expansile lesion of the frontal bone.  Low in signal on T1, high signal on T2, and avid enhancement post contrast.  Foci of high signal on T1 are noted, most likely representing fat.","53 y/o man with history of basal cell carcinoma presents with painful lump on right forehead.

Incidentally, a lucent lesion with a well defined cortical margin was found along the lateral distal tibia, consistent with a nonossifying fibroma.

Figure 2:  Follow-up A-P radiograph of the right distal tibia and fibula 15 months after the initial injury shows a bilocular lytic lesion of the metaphysis and a unilocular lytic lesion of the epiphysis at the medial aspect of the tibia. The lesions are surrounded by a well defined sclerotic border with benign-appearing periosteal reaction and mild soft tissue swelling medially. The metaphyseal lesions extend across the physis into the epiphysis. There are no fracture lucencies and the joint spaces are maintained.  The nonossifying fibroma of the lateral distal tibia is unchanged.

Figure 3:  A Tc-99m HDP bone scan demonstrates increased radiotracer uptake at the distal tibial meta-epiphysis, most marked on the medial aspect of the epiphysis.

Figure 4:  Axial T1-weighted MR image of right leg reveals multiple well defined low signal intensity masses surrounded by a thick medium intensity rim with a low signal intensity periphery. The tibial metaphyseal component measures 2.1cm longitudinal x 1.6cm transverse x 2.1cm AP.  The epiphyseal component measures 2 cm longitudinal x 2.3cm transverse x 3cm AP.  The inflammatory process extends posteromedially through the cortex of the tibial epiphysis to involve the adjacent soft tissues. 

Figure 5:  On axial T2-weighted fat saturated MR image of the right leg, masses become high-signal intensity surrounded by low-signal intensity rims. The high signal-intensity inflammation extends into the adjacent soft tissues.

Post-contrast T1-weighted with fat saturation MR images of the left foot in both the axial (not shown) and sagittal planes show enhancement of the head of the first metatarsal, the tibial sesamoid, and surrounding soft tissues.  On post-contrast MR images, no necrosis in muscles or soft tissues, manifested by nonenhancing areas, are found.

These combined findings on fat-suppressed and contrast-enhanced MR images are consistent with myositis and cellulitis of the soft tissues and osteomyelitis of the head of the first metatarsal and tibial sesamoid.  The tendons of the tarsus and foot are normal.","The patient is an 83-year-old, African-American woman with a history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, hepatitis C, and neurosyphilis, who was admitted to the hospital for worsening of a chronic, nonhealing, left-foot ulcer that had been followed closely by the Podiatry service with repeated debridements and courses of oral antibiotics.  On the current admission, the patient denied having had any fevers, chills, or feelings of malaise, but stated that her glycemic control had been poor.","Post-contrast T1-weighted with fat saturation MR image of the left foot in sagittal plane shows no necrosis in muscles or soft tissues, which would be manifested by nonenhancing areas.",,,83,female,Sagittal,Musculoskeletal

 MR imaging is useful in assessing the degree of tendon damage in 4-10% of the cases that are resistant  to conservative therapy.  Tendon degeneration is manifested by normal to increased tendon thickness with increased signal intensity in T1-weighted images that does not further increase in signal intensity on the T2-weighted images.  Complete tears may be diagnosed on MR imaging by identifying a fluid filled gap separating the tendon from its adjacent bony attachment site.
Magnetic resonance imaging is useful in identifying high grade partial tears and complete tears that are unlikely to improve with rest and repeated steroid injections.  The lack of a significant abnormality involving the common extensor tendon on MR imaging may prompt consideration of an alternate diagnosis such as radial nerve entrapment which may mimic or accompany lateral epicondylitis.

There is high signal intensity degenerative edema of the femoral heads on T2. Superior acetabula demonstrate low signal intensity on T1 and associated osteophyte and subchondral cyst formation. The bilateral femoral heads demonstrate extensive osteoarthritic changes with sclerosis, cyst formation, bilateral ring osteophytes and some mild flattening of the femoral heads.

Yesterday morning she noted that she began dragging her left side. A few hours later the weakness was more obvious and involved her left hand. She had a CT scan that was nonspecifically abnormal because of ""cerebral atrophy"", but no stroke was seen. She was admitted with a provisional diagnosis of stroke vs. transient ischemic attack. 

Her right side was not involved. There was no visual loss. There was no facial weakness. She noted that left sided sensations were diminished as compared to the right. She denied a history of strokes.

Since that time, she has regained strength in her left leg, however today she noticed a slight slurring of her speech and was unable to lift her arm off the bed.

Yesterday morning she noted that she began dragging her left side. A few hours later the weakness was more obvious and involved her left hand. She had a CT scan that was nonspecifically abnormal because of ""cerebral atrophy"", but no stroke was seen. She was admitted with a provisional diagnosis of stroke vs. transient ischemic attack. 

Her right side was not involved. There was no visual loss. There was no facial weakness. She noted that left sided sensations were diminished as compared to the right. She denied a history of strokes.

Since that time, she has regained strength in her left leg, however today she noticed a slight slurring of her speech and was unable to lift her arm off the bed.
