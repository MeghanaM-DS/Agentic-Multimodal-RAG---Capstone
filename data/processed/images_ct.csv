HISTORY
Patient was product of pregnancy complicated by pre-eclampsia. Patient was born at 27weeks after 2 days of antenatal steroids. Significant respiratory distress requiring intubation was noted immediately after birth. 

Neonatal course included multiple doses of surfactant. 68 days mechanical ventilation, and 3 months of NICU care. Complications included multiple episodes of pneumonia, presumed sepsis, NEC, anemia, and electrolyte abnormalities. 

The patient was discharged home on O2 which she used until 9 months of age, as well as Fe, diuretics, steroids.

After 1 year of age, patient began to have multiple episodes of pneumonia, bronchitis, and asthma requiring hospitalization. Anemia, requiring 2 transfusions, was noted in context of one episode of pneumonia. 

In addition, the patient experienced failure to thrive, reaching less than 3% height/weight for her age.

CT scan is most useful and can demonstrate a radiolucent zone of periosteum and fibrous tissue trapped between the tumor and cortex.

The child had consistently been at the fifth percentile for growth up to that point. An ultrasound in Italy revealed a 7 x 8cm abdominal mass, and she was immediately air-evac’d to WRAMC for further evaluation and treatment.","CT in the axial plane demonstrates a heterogeneous mass in the right kidney, with considerable mass effect. The liver and IVC are markedly compressed with no obvious invasion. Initial measurements of this mass were 15.4 cm in the craniocaudal dimension, 12.3 cm in the AP dimension, and 7.7 cm in the lateral dimension. The left kidney is normal with no evidence of masses or hydronephrosis. 

Coronal and sagittal reconstructed views demonstrate a well-circumscribed mass that has most likely infiltrated the right renal capsule. Cystic regions within the mass are most notable on the sagittal view. The lateral image shows medial displacement of functioning right renal parenchyma (i.e., claw sign) with contrast excretion, and there is normal excretion from the left kidney. The right adrenal gland and right renal vein are not well visualized.
